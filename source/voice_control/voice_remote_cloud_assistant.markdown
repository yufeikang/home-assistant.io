Before being able to use Assist, you need to configure it.

The simplest and most effective way to use Assist is to leverage the voice providers (for speech-to-text and test-to-speech) included in Home Assistant Cloud.
This page will detail how to do just that.

If you are interested in setting up a fully local voice assistant, follow this procedure instead 


## Setting up a cloud Assist pipeline

To have the fastest processing voice assistant experience, follow these steps:

1. If you haven't done this already, [enable Home Assistant Cloud](https://www.nabucasa.com/config/).
2. As soon as you're connected to Home Assistant Cloud, a voice assistant has been created for you.
   - This voice assistant is using text-to-speech and speech-to-text engines based on the region settings of your Home Assistant user.
3. To view the settings, go to {% my voice_assistants title="**Settings** > **Voice assistants**" %} and under **Assist**, select **Home Assistant Cloud**.

     - **Troubleshooting**: If you do not see any assistants here, you are not using the default configuration. In this case, you need to add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

       ```yaml
       # Example configuration.yaml entry
       assist_pipeline:
       ```
4. If the predefined language settings work for you, skip the next step.
5. If you want to make some changes:
   - If you like, change the name. You can pick any name that is meaningful to you.
   - If you do not agree with the predefined language, select the language that you want to speak.
   - Under **Conversation agent**, select **Home Assistant**.
   - Under **Speech-to-text**, select the language you want to speak.
   - Under **Text-to-speech**, select the language you want Assist to use when speaking to you.
   - Depending on your language, you may be able to select different language variants.

6. That's it. You can now speak to your device, and the device can answer in the language you defined.

Once Assist is configured, now can now start using it. Check this page to learn how:
