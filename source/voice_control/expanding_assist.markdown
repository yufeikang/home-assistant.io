Once you have completed the steps in the [Best practices](/voice_control/best_practices/), you have your bases covered and are ready to use Assist. This section provides some ideas on how to expand your setup for more advanced use cases.

## PrerequisitesÂ 

Assist [up and running](/voice_control/) in any of the available devices and configured as per the [best practices](/voice_control/best_practices/).

## Some ideas to expand your Assist setup

1. Add custom sentences or modify existing ones. Learn how in this [custom sentences tutorial](/voice_control/custom_sentences/).
2. [Create a personality](voice_control/assist_create_open_ai_personality/) for Assist using AI
3. Customize your [own wake words ](/voice_control/create_wake_word/) for Assist - only available if you have your own hardware setup like [ESP32-S3 BOX](/voice_control/s3_box_voice_assistant/) or [ATOM Echo](/voice_control/thirteen-usd-voice-remote/).
4. If you want to build something really customized, you can [make your own Assist device](/voice_control/make_your_own/).
