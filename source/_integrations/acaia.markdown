The **Acaia** {% term integration %} allows you to control [Acaia](https://acaia.co/) scales through Home Assistant.

If your machine is within Bluetooth range to your Home Assistant host and the [Bluetooth](/integrations/bluetooth) integration is fully loaded, the scale should be discovered automatically. If you are configuring the device manually, your scale needs to be turned on during setup. 

Once the integration is setup, Home Assistant will try to connect to your scale every 15 seconds. This means there is sometimes a small delay between you turning the scale on and Home Assistant connecting to it.

# Available platforms & entities

## Binary sensors

- **Timer running**: Whether the timer is currently running on the scale

## Buttons

- **Tare**: Tares the scale.
- **Reset timer**: Resets the timer. If the timer is running, it will continue to run.
- **Start/stop timer**: Starts or stops the timer, depending on whether the timer is currently running. Does not reset, but continue the timer.

## Sensors

- **Battery**: Current battery level of the scale.
- **Volume flow rate**: Calculates the current flow rate (in mL/s) while brewing.
- **Weight**: The weight currently shown on the scale.

## Supported devices

The following devices have been tested successfully with this integration:

- Lunar (manufactured after 2021)
- Pyxis

If you have successfully tested this integration with another Acaia model, please let us know by enhancing this documentation, or by opening an issue in GitHub.

## Possible use-cases

This integration can be used in combination with integrations for smart coffee machines, such as the [La Marzocco integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/lamarzocco/) integration.
It could also be used to display the weight on secondary displays when brewing on a Pyxis or Lunar where you cannot see the display.

## Automations

Get started with these automation examples.

### Tare & start timer when brew starts

## Known limitations

- While this integration is configured for your device, you won't be able to use the official app, as only one connection at a time is supported.

## Remove integration

This integration follows standard integration removal, no extra steps are required.

## Troubleshooting

{% details "Device not discovered or found" %}

Make sure your scale is turned on and in Bluetooth range to your Home Assistant instance. [ESPHome Bluetooth Proxies](https://esphome.io/components/bluetooth_proxy.html) are a great way to increase the range if your instance is too far away. Turn on debug settings in the acaia integration and check your logs.
