The **Enphase Envoy** {% term integration %} is used to integrate with the [Enphase IQ Gateway](https://enphase.com/en-us/products-and-services/envoy-and-combiner), a communication device for [Enphase](https://enphase.com/homeowners) solar inverters and batteries. In this documentation, as well as in integration entity names, the Enphase IQ Gateway is commonly referred to as `Envoy`, a name from the conception times of this integration and retained for its compact format.

## Supported devices

This integration works with:

- Older and newer <abbr title="IQ Gateway">Envoy</abbr> models that only have production metrics (such as Envoy-R (LCD), Envoy-S (not metered))
- Newer <abbr title="IQ Gateway">Envoy</abbr> models that offer both production and consumption metrics (such as Envoy-S Metered equipped with <abbr title="current transformers">CT</abbr>).
- Various Enphase IQ Combiner products that have an embedded <abbr title="IQ Gateway">Envoy</abbr>, it will show-up in the same way as the stand-alone one.

## Unsupported devices

This integration does not work with:

- Older Envoy models running firmware before 3.9 which lack a REST API.

## Prerequisites

- The <abbr title="IQ Gateway">Envoy</abbr> must be configured and commissioned.
- The <abbr title="IQ Gateway">Envoy</abbr> must be on your local network with IPV4 connectivity from Home Assistant. (Also See troubleshooting, [single network](#single-network))
- <abbr title="IQ Gateway">Envoy</abbr> firmware version 3.9 or newer.
- With <abbr title="IQ Gateway">Envoy</abbr> firmware 7 and greater:
  - an Enlighten cloud username and password.
  - Home Assistant 2023.9 or newer.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

### Required Manual input

The configuration of an individual Envoy requires you to enter the following information:

{% configuration_basic %}

Host:
  description: "The name or IP address of the Envoy to configure. <br> Will be pre-filled if the Envoy was auto-discovered"
Username:
  description: "For firmware version 7.0 and later, enter your Enlighten cloud username. The Enlighten cloud username (and password) will be used to obtain a 1-year-valid token from the enphase web-site when first configured or upon expiry.
  <br> For firmware before 7.0, enter username *installer* without a password."
Password:
  description: "For firmware version 7.0 and later, enter your Enlighten cloud password <br> For firmware before 7.0, with username *installer*, leave blank."
{% endconfiguration_basic %}

{% include integrations/option_flow.md %}

Options to enable/disable are listed below. Neither of these are set by default nor need to be set for proper functioning of the integration. Setting these options is only required in described circumstances.

{% configuration_basic %}
Collect test fixture data in diagnostics report:
  description: "No/Yes <br> When new features are requested or firmware is upgraded, it can happen that existing test fixtures no longer cover all test cases and new ones are needed. You may be requested to provide data for such test fixtures. If so, and you are willing to provide the data, setting this option enables the collection of test data as part of the [diagnostics report](#fixtures)."
Always use a new connection when requesting data from the Envoy:
  description: "No/Yes <br> Some older Envoy firmware may exhibit connection issues when using the default keep-alive connection and report failures. When set, this option disables the use of keep-alive and builds a new connection at each data request. This makes the communication more reliable for these firmware versions. Reported for the Envoy-R, but may apply to other older firmware versions as well."
{% endconfiguration_basic %}

## Reconfigure

This integration supports updating the Envoy configuration through a `reconfigure` menu option. The reconfiguration allows for changing the Envoy IP address, username, and/or password. Use this menu option if your Enlighten credentials or the device's IP address has changed and needs to be manually updated. The latter is typically automatically detected and updated.

Use this menu option also when an Envoy firmware upgrade requires a switch from local Envoy username/password to token-based authentication with Enlighten username/password (refer to [required manual input](#required-manual-input)).

## Removing the integration

This integration follows standard integration removal. No extra steps are required.

{% include integrations/remove_device_service.md %}

## Capabilities

This integration offers various entities depending on the configuration of your Enphase system. The Envoy can communicate with Enphase IQ micro-inverters, Enphase ACB and IQ batteries, Enphase Ensemble Enpower switch and load shedding relays and Enphase compatible generators.

{% note %}

- You may know referred product names under other names from the past or future.
- In this documentation, the term SN is used for a device serial-number placeholder. Entities will contain the actual serial-number of the device.
{% endnote %}

### Solar production data

All Envoy models with solar inverters, with or without installed production <abbr title="current transformers">CT</abbr>, for all firmware versions, report solar current and historical production data.

### House consumption data

House consumption data requires an Envoy Metered equipped and configured with at least 1 consumption <abbr title="current transformers">[CT](#current-transformers)</abbr>.

#### Consumption Sensor Entities

- **Envoy <abbr title="Envoy serial number">SN</abbr> Current power consumption**: Current power consumption in W.
- **Envoy <abbr title="Envoy serial number">SN</abbr> Lifetime energy consumption**: Lifetime energy consumption in Wh, default display scaled to MWh.
- **Envoy <abbr title="Envoy serial number">SN</abbr> Energy production last seven days**: Energy consumption in previous 7 days, not including today's, in Wh, display scaled to kWh. This entity is not logged in statistics.
- **Envoy <abbr title="Envoy serial number">SN</abbr> Energy consumption today**: Energy consumption since midnight in Wh, default display scaled to kWh.

<figure>
  <img src="/images/integrations/enphase_envoy/enphase_envoy_consumption.png" alt="consumption entities">
  <figcaption>Envoy metered with CT reporting production and consumption entities.</figcaption>
</figure>

When used with [multiphase CT phase data](#ct-aggregate-and-phase-data), disabled phase entities are available but not shown. Enable as needed.

### Current Transformers

The Envoy Metered can be equipped with up-to 6 <abbr title="current transformers">CT</abbr>. These can be assigned to production, consumption and/or storage measurements in single or multiple phase setups.

The below diagram shows CT installation positions and how they are referred to.

- The production CT measures the energy exchange between Solar production and the switchboard.
- If the consumption CT is installed as **Load only** a.k.a.  **total-consumption** it measures energy exchange from the switchboard to the loads/house.
- If the consumption CT is installed as **Load with Solar** a.k.a. **net-consumption**, it measures energy exchange between the switchboard and the grid.
- The storage CT measures the energy exchange between the battery storage and the switchboard.

{% note %}
This in no way represents a configuration direction, as actual configuration is driven by local rules, installer designs and Enphase installation guidelines. Variations may exist, based on specific needs or rules. This merely describes a simplified view and naming conventions used in this documentation to clarify integration operation. Refer to [Enphase documentation](https://enphase.com/installers/resources/documentation/communication) for more information.
{% endnote %}

When an Envoy Metered is equipped with a production CT, the CT data will be used to provide the [aggregated solar production data](#aggregated-production-data). Likewise, the installed consumption CT will be the source for the [house consumption data](#house-consumption-data).

Either a net-consumption or a total-consumption CT is installed. The Envoy will calculate the data for the other one.

#### CT Aggregate and phase data

When using <abbr title="current transformers">[CT](#current-transformers)</abbr> in multiphase enabled configurations, both aggregated and individual phase data is available. If only 1 phase is configured, phase data is the same as the aggregated data and no phase entities are created. If more than 1 phase is configured, disabled phase entities for each phase are created, enable them as needed.

Phase entity names are the names used for the aggregated entities, with the phase name in the post-fix. Phase names are **L1**, **L2**, **L3**. For example, once enabled, [**lifetime energy production**](#solar-production-data) on phase 3 is available as **Envoy <abbr title="Envoy serial number">SN</abbr> Lifetime energy production L3**.

#### Current transformer entities

CT measure multiple properties of the energy exchange which are available as Envoy device entities. These are all disabled by default, enable them as desired.

##### Production CT sensor entities

- **Envoy <abbr title="Envoy serial number">SN</abbr> Frequency production CT**: Frequency in Hz.

- **Envoy <abbr title="Envoy serial number">SN</abbr> Meter status flags active net consumption CT**: Count of CT status flags active. See troubleshooting [CT Active flag count](#ct-active-flag-count) when non-zero.

##### Storage CT sensor entities

- **Envoy <abbr title="Envoy serial number">SN</abbr> Frequency storage CT**: Frequency in Hz.
- **Envoy <abbr title="Envoy serial number">SN</abbr> Voltage storage CT**: Voltage in V. (see limitations [Summed voltage](#summed-voltage)

- **Envoy <abbr title="Envoy serial number">SN</abbr> Metering status storage CT**: Status of the metering process: `normal`, `not-metering`, `check-wiring`.
- **Envoy <abbr title="Envoy serial number">SN</abbr> Meter status flags active storage CT**: Count of CT status flags active. See troubleshooting [CT Active flag count](#ct-active-flag-count) when non-zero.

For storage CT energy entities refer to [battery sensor](#aggregated-iq-battery-sensor-entities) description.

### Grid sensor entities

When the Envoy Metered is equipped with a [net-consumption CT](#current-transformers), entities for Grid import and export are available.

- **Envoy <abbr title="Envoy serial number">SN</abbr> Current net power consumption**: Current power exchange from (positive) / to (negative) the grid in W, default display in kW.
- **Envoy <abbr title="Envoy serial number">SN</abbr> Lifetime net energy consumption**: Lifetime energy consumed / imported from the grid in Wh, default display in MWh.
- **Envoy <abbr title="Envoy serial number">SN</abbr> Lifetime net energy production**: Lifetime energy produced / exported to the grid in Wh, default display in MWh.

When used with [multiphase CT phase data](#ct-aggregate-and-phase-data), disabled phase entities are available as well.

#### Grid Balanced import/export sensor entities

When the Envoy Metered is equipped with a [total-consumption CT](#current-transformers) instead of a [net-consumption CT](#current-transformers), no individual entities for Grid import and export are available, as these are not measured. Instead, the balance (difference) of grid import and export is available in a single entity, disabled by default, enable as desired.

- **Envoy <abbr title="Envoy serial number">SN</abbr> balanced net power consumption**: Current power exchange from (positive) / to (negative) the grid in W, default display in kW.
  (This is the same value as [Envoy <abbr title="Envoy serial number">SN</abbr> Current net power consumption](#grid-sensor-entities) when using a net-consumption CT.)
- **Envoy <abbr title="Envoy serial number">SN</abbr> Lifetime balanced net energy consumption**: Lifetime energy balance (difference) of imported and exported grid energy in Wh, default display in kWh.

When used with [multiphase CT phase data](#ct-aggregate-and-phase-data), disabled phase entities are available as well.

### Battery Storage data

Enphase battery systems of multiple generations and configurations can provide integration entity data.

- **AC-Batteries**: first generation battery setup, no longer in production.

### Enpower data

Data for an installed Enphase Enpower off-grid enabling switch is available in various entities for an Enpower device.

#### Enpower binary sensor entities

- **Enpower <abbr title="Enpower serial number">SN</abbr> Grid status**: status of the grid.

#### Enpower number entities

- **Enpower <abbr title="Enpower serial number">SN</abbr> Reserve battery level**: reserve battery level to maintain for outages in %.

{% note %}
If no Enpower is installed, then **Charge from grid**, **Reserve battery level**, and **Storage mode** are available as [Envoy device entities](#aggregated-iq-battery-data) instead of Enpower device entities.
{% endnote %}

### Enpower load shedding relays

With the Enpower/IQ System Controller installed, entities for the state and control of the Enpower's four load-shedding relays are available. In battery installations without load-shedding and off-grid functionality, used in many EU countries, these sensors and switches are not available.

The Enphase Enpower has 4 load shedding relays (volt-free contacts, often referred to as dry-contacts) that can be used to control non-essential loads in your home. These have two main modes of operation:

- **Standard**: When the mode entity is set to standard, you can simply set the state of the relay to be powered or not powered for each mode of operation: on grid, off grid, and on generator.

- **Battery level**: When the relay mode is set to battery level, the relays will turn on and off based on the remaining battery level of your Encharge IQ batteries. Two number entities are available to control the cutoff and restore levels for the relays. When the battery level drops below the cutoff level, the relays will turn off, removing power from attached loads. When the battery level rises above the restore level, the relays will turn back on and restore power to attached loads.

The names of entities and devices are derived from the load_name configured in the Enpower device.

#### Dry-contact number entities

- **<abbr title="dry_contacts.load_name">LOAD_NAME</abbr> cutoff battery level**: battery level below which relay will turn off when in `Battery level` mode.
- **<abbr title="dry_contacts.load_name">LOAD_NAME</abbr> restore battery level**: battery level above which the relay will turn back on when in `Battery level` mode.

#### Dry-contact select entities

- **<abbr title="dry_contacts.load_name">LOAD_NAME</abbr> mode**: dry-contact operational mode: `standard` or `battery`
- **<abbr title="dry_contacts.load_name">LOAD_NAME</abbr> Grid action**: dry-contact on grid action: `Powered`, `Not powered`, `Follow schedule`, `None`
- **<abbr title="dry_contacts.load_name">LOAD_NAME</abbr> Micro-grid action**: dry-contact on micro-grid action: `Powered`, `Not powered`, `Follow schedule`, `None`
- **<abbr title="dry_contacts.load_name">LOAD_NAME</abbr> Generator action**: dry-contact on generator action:  `Powered`, `Not powered`, `Follow schedule`, `None`

  <figcaption>Envoy Enpower dry-contact entities.</figcaption>
</figure>

## Data polling interval

All data is collected in one coordinated collection cycle and sourced from a limited set of endpoints on the Envoy. For example, three different values sourced from the same endpoint are not pulled in three different requests but provided from the same single request. This method minimizes the number of requests to the Envoy. The local REST API of the Envoy is used. Only when the 1-year valid token is to expire, 1 month before due data, a new token is requested from the Enphase Enlighten website.

The integration collects data for all entities by default every 60 seconds. To customize the collection interval, refer to [defining a custom polling interval](/common-tasks/general/#defining-a-custom-polling-interval). Specify one single entity from the envoy device as target of the action using the `+ choose entity` button. Updating one entity will update all entities of the Envoy and the related devices like the inverters; there is no need to specify multiple or all entities or add (all) inverter entities. When using multiple Envoys, add one entity for each envoy as targets or create separate custom polling intervals with a single entity as needed.

Envoy installations without installed <abbr title="current transformers">CT</abbr>, collect individual solar inverter data every 5 minutes. This collection does not occur for each inverter at the same time in the 5-minute period. Shortening the collection interval will at best show updates for individual inverters quicker, but not yield more granular data.

With installed <abbr title="current transformers">CT</abbr>, data granularity increases and shortening the collection interval can provide more details. The Envoy, however, has no unlimited resources and shortening the collection interval may result in dropped connections, Envoy freeze or restarts. It will require some step-wise tuning for each individual situation.

## Credentials or device IP address update

This integration supports updating the Envoy configuration through a `reconfigure` menu option. The reconfiguration allows for changing the Envoy IP address, username, and/or password. Use this menu option if your Enlighten credentials or the device's IP address has changed and needs to be manually updated. The latter is typically automatically detected and updated.

Use this menu option also when an Envoy firmware upgrade requires a switch from local Envoy username/password to token-based authentication with Enlighten username/password (refer to [authentication requirements](#envoy-authentication-requirements)).

## Firmware updates

The firmware version is read from the envoy when the configuration entry is loaded. The firmware version is then used in the process of determining capabilities and required authorization methods. The firmware version is available as the `sw_version` attribute of the configuration entry and shown on the device view of the envoy.

Every 4 hours, the actual firmware version in the Envoy is compared to the known one. If the actual version differs, the configuration entry is reloaded to effect any needed configuration changes. If the moment of the firmware update is known, a manual reload on the envoy configuration entry can be done to achieve the same.

The firmware version is not available as an entity, but rather as an attribute of the envoy. To use the firmware in automation, scripts or templates, use below example with any envoy entity.

{% raw %}

```yaml
{{device_attr(device_id('sensor.envoy_SN_current_power_production'),'sw_version')}}
```

{% endraw %}

## Energy dashboard

This integration provides several entities suitable for the energy dashboard.

### Solar panels

For **Solar production**, use the **Envoy <abbr title="Envoy serial number">SN</abbr> Lifetime energy production** entity. Overall this has proven to be more stable as the daily value reported by the Envoy. (See known limitations [Late reset](#late-reset), [Energy Incorrect](#energy-incorrect)).

### Electricity grid

Whether there is data available to use with the electricity grid depends on the installed <abbr title="current transformers">CT</abbr>, if any. Also, see Limitations, [Balancing grid meter](#balancing-grid-meter).

#### Electricity grid with net-consumption CT

With a [net-consumption CT](#grid-sensor-entities) installed, both grid consumption and return to grid data is available.

- For **Grid consumption**, use the **Envoy <abbr title="Envoy serial number">SN</abbr> Lifetime net energy consumption** entity.
- For **Return to grid**, use the **Envoy <abbr title="Envoy serial number">SN</abbr> Lifetime net energy production** entity.

#### Electricity grid with total-consumption CT

With a [total-consumption CT](#grid-balanced-importexport-sensor-entities) installed, only the balanced grid import-export value is available. This value is not suited for direct use with the energy dashboard. It will require some templating to split the value into an import and export value.

{% details "Concept to split balanced Grid value into individual import-export values" %}

The concept is to track value changes of the **Envoy <abbr title="Envoy serial number">SN</abbr> Lifetime balanced net energy consumption** entity, add positive changes to a grid_import entity and add negative changes to a grid_export entity.

{% raw %}

```yaml

- trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: sensor.envoy_sn_lifetime_balanced_net_energy_consumption
  
  sensor:
    - name: "Grid import"
      unique_id: calculated_envoy_grid_import
      unit_of_measurement: "Wh" 
      state: "{{ this.state | int(0) + ([0, (trigger.to_state.state | int(0) - trigger.from_state.state | int(0))] | max }}" 
      device_class: energy 
      state_class: total_increasing 
    - name: "Grid export"
      unique_id: calculated_envoy_grid_export
      unit_of_measurement: "Wh" 
      state: "{{ this.state | int(0) - ([0, (trigger.to_state.state | int(0) - trigger.from_state.state | int(0))] | min }}" 
      device_class: energy

The above example does not address handling `unavailable` or `unknown` states, value changes over Home Assistant outages nor changing UOM to a preferred one. Examples for these exist in various community topics.

Alternatively, this can be done by splitting the **Envoy <abbr title="Envoy serial number">SN</abbr> balanced net power consumption** into power import and export and two Riemann sum integral helpers to calculate energy from the power values.

### Home battery storage

Whether there is data available to use with the electricity grid depends on the installed storage <abbr title="current transformers">CT</abbr>, if any.

#### Home battery storage with storage CT

With a [storage CT](#aggregated-iq-battery-sensor-entities) installed, data for both Energy coming out and going into the battery is available.

- For **Energy going into the battery**, use the **Envoy <abbr title="Envoy serial number">SN</abbr> Lifetime battery energy charged** entity.
- For **Energy coming out of the battery**, use the **Envoy <abbr title="Envoy serial number">SN</abbr> Lifetime battery energy discharged** entity.

#### Home battery storage without storage CT

Without a [storage CT](#aggregated-iq-battery-sensor-entities) installed, only the current Power in and out of individual batteries, or the current aggregated battery energy content is available. These values are not suited for direct use with the energy dashboard. It will require some templating to split the value into an import and export values.

##### Home battery storage data using battery power

Battery power is the current power flow in or out of an individual battery. Using the summed Power values of all batteries, the result needs to be split in 2 entities, representing total power in and power out. Next, each entity needs to be integrated into energy, using two Riemann sum integral helpers. The resulting data can be used for Energy going into the battery and Energy coming out of the battery.

{% details "Concept to split Battery power value into individual import-export power values" %}

The concept is to first sum all battery Power values using a combine state helper. Then track value changes of the summed value entity, add positive changes to a battery_charge power entity and add negative changes to a battery_discharge power entity.

{% raw %}

```yaml

- trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: sensor.envoy_sn_summed_battery_power_entity
  
  sensor:
    - name: "Battery charge power"
      unique_id: calculated_envoy_battery_charge_power
      unit_of_measurement: "W" 
      state: "{{ this.state | int(0) + ([0, (trigger.to_state.state | int(0) - trigger.from_state.state | int(0))] | max }}" 
      device_class: power 
      state_class: measurement
    - name: "Battery discharge power"
      unique_id: calculated_envoy_battery_discharge_power
      unit_of_measurement: "W" 
      state: "{{ this.state | int(0) - ([0, (trigger.to_state.state | int(0) - trigger.from_state.state | int(0))] | min }}" 
      device_class: power 
      state_class: measurement
```

{% endraw %}

The above example does not address handling `unavailable` or `unknown` states, value changes over Home Assistant outages nor conversion losses.

{% enddetails %}

##### Home battery storage data on the available battery energy

Changes in the Available battery energy are a result from Energy going in or out of the battery. Splitting these energy changes into 2 entities, one tracking positive changes, one the negative changes, results in data that can be used for Energy going into the battery and Energy coming out off the battery. This method does not account for conversion losses as Energy content changes do not exactly match actual energy flow in and out of the battery.

{% details "Concept to split Available battery energy value into individual import-export values" %}

The concept is to track value changes of the **Envoy <abbr title="Envoy serial number">SN</abbr> Available battery energy** entity, add positive changes to a battery_charge entity and add negative changes to a battery_discharge entity.

{% raw %}

```yaml

- trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: sensor.envoy_sn_available_battery_energy
  
  sensor:
    - name: "Battery charge"
      unique_id: calculated_envoy_battery_charge
      unit_of_measurement: "Wh" 
      state: "{{ this.state | int(0) + ([0, (trigger.to_state.state | int(0) - trigger.from_state.state | int(0))] | max }}" 
      device_class: energy 
      state_class: total_increasing
    - name: "Battery discharge"
      unique_id: calculated_envoy_battery_discharge
      unit_of_measurement: "Wh"

## Know issues and limitations

### Firmware changes

[Envoy firmware](https://enphase.com/installers/resources/documentation/communication?&f[0]=document%3A217) versions come with changing behavior, features, and potential issues. Firmware is pushed to the Envoy by Enphase, while 'not always communicated in detail upfront'. This may result in sudden changes in the Envoy behavior and is always accompanied by an outage while Envoy is being updated.

### No battery controls

As of Envoy firmware 8.2.4225, the Envoy no longer supports the following operations through the local REST API used by Home Assistant:

- Setting battery modes
- Enabling/disabling charging from the grid
- Changing reserve battery level

Until a resolution is found, you must use the Enphase App to control these features.

### Late reset

When using Envoy Metered with <abbr title="current transformers">CT</abbr>, not all firmware versions reset 'Energy production today' at midnight. Delays of up to 15 minutes have been reported. In this case, best use a utility meter with the `Lifetime energy production` entity for daily reporting.

### Energy incorrect

When using Envoy Metered with <abbr title="current transformers">CT</abbr>

- not all firmware versions report `Energy production today` correctly. Zero data and unexpected spikes have been reported. In this case, best use a utility meter with the `Lifetime energy production` entity for daily reporting.
- not all firmware versions report `Energy production last seven days` correctly. Zero and unexpected values have been reported.

### Lifetime reset

Envoy Metered without installed CT, running older firmware versions, reportedly resets **Lifetime energy production** to 0 when reaching 1.2 MWh. For use with the energy dashboard, the reset is not an issue. In a recent firmware version 8.x.x the reset is solved, but results in a one-time step change to the full lifetime value. This has impact on the energy dashboard, it can be solved by setting the statistics value for that moment to 0 in  [Developer Tools: Statistics](/docs/tools/dev-tools/#statistics-tab)

  <figcaption>Envoy Lifetime energy production value reset.</figcaption>
</figure>

{% enddetails %}

### Summed Voltage

The Envoy Metered in multiphase setup, sums the voltages of the phases measured on the CT for the aggregated data. This may be valid for split-phase, but for 3-phase systems, use the individual phases rather than the summed value.

### Balancing grid meter

In multiphase installations with batteries, in countries with phase-balancing grid meters, the battery will export to the grid on one phase the amount it lacks on another phase. This other phase pulls the missing amount from the grid, as if it is using the grid as a 'transport' between phases. Since the grid meter will balance the amount imported and exported on the two phases, the net result is zero. The Envoy multiphase net-consumption CTs, however, will report the amounts on both phases, resulting in too high export on one and too high import on the other. One may consider using the `lifetime balanced net energy consumption` which is the sum of grid import and export to eliminate this effect. This would require some templating to split these values into import and export values. Alternatively, use the `current net power consumption` or `balanced net power consumption` with a Riemann integral sum helper.

## Troubleshooting

### Periodic network connection issues

If you experience periodic connection issues, ensure the Envoy is connected to only one interface (either Ethernet OR Wi-Fi, not both). The Envoy should not be both on your local LAN (Ethernet) and local Wi-Fi simultaneously. Having both connections active can cause auto-discovery to alternate between interfaces, resulting in connection interruptions approximately every 30 minutes.

### CT Active flag count is non-zero

The **CT active flag count** value shows the number of CT status flags that are raised. In a normal state, the value of **CT active flag count** is zero. If the value is non-zero, consult the [diagnostic](#diagnostics) report of the Envoy and look for `raw_data` - `/ivp/meters` - `statusFlags` for set flags, one or more from  (`production-imbalance` | `negative-production` | `power-on-unused-phase` | `negative-total-consumption`). Their somewhat descriptive names may be an indication of installation issues.

### Debug logs and diagnostics

This integration provides debug log and {% term diagnostics %} report as described in the [Home Assistant troubleshooting pages](/docs/configuration/troubleshooting/#debug-logs-and-diagnostics).

#### Debug log

When experiencing issues during the use of the integration, enable the debug log for the <abbr title="IQ Gateway">Envoy</abbr>. Then restart the integration. This will add details on the data collection to the Home Assistant log file. Leave the debug log enabled long enough to capture the occurrence of the issue. If the issue is intermittent, this may take a while and it may grow the log file quite a bit.

If you're expecting features to show but they are not shown, make sure to reload the integration while debug logging is enabled.
When this integration is loaded, it will scan the <abbr title="IQ Gateway">Envoy</abbr> for available features and configure these as needed. Following this initial scan, only data for the found features is collected.  Performing a reload with debug enabled results in the debug log containing the initial full scan to assist with analyzing any missing features. Some features are disabled by default, and you need to enable them if you want them to show. Verify this before starting a debug session.

Once the issue occurred, stop the debug logging again (_download of debug log file will start automatically_). When reporting the issue, include the debug log file as well as a [{% term diagnostics %}](#diagnostics) file.

The debug log will show all communication with the Envoy / IQ Gateway. Lines starting with below examples are log entries for the integration:

```txt
2024-03-07 11:20:11.897 DEBUG (MainThread) [homeassistant.components.enphase_envoy
2024-03-07 11:20:11.898 DEBUG (MainThread) [pyenphase
```

Below a typical data request / reply sequence in the log file. These lines will contain the data details received from the <abbr title="IQ Gateway">Envoy</abbr>.

```txt
... [pyenphase.envoy] Requesting https://192.168.1.2/ivp/meters with timeout ...
... [pyenphase.envoy] Request reply from https://192.168.1.2/ivp/meters status 200:...
```

The end of a collection cycle is marked by:

```txt
... [homeassistant.components.enphase_envoy.coordinator] Finished fetching Envoy 123456 data in 1.234 seconds (success: True)
```

#### Diagnostics

The {% term diagnostics %} data file is a JSON file and includes a `data` section with the details for this integration. The file can be viewed with any text editor. The data section has up to 6 major subsections which reflect how the integration is set up and data is used. Include the file when reporting issues.

Below the 6 subsections, each collapsed.

```JSON
  "data": {
    "config_entry": { ...
    },
    "envoy_properties": { ...
    },
    "raw_data": { ...

    "envoy_model_data": { ...
    },
    "envoy_entities_by_device": [ ...
    ],
    "fixtures" : { ...
    }
  }
}    
```

##### Config entry

Shows the integration configuration created when the integration was added.

##### Envoy properties

Shows the conclusions of the initial data scan and what features were identified, including the detected firmware version in the Envoy.

##### Raw data

Shows the data collected from the Envoy during the last data scan when the diagnostic report was created. If in doubt about data shown in the dashboards, consult this section to find the raw data sent by the Envoy. The integration is not modifying this data, it's just providing the data to the entities.

##### Envoy model data

Shows the data of the Envoy extracted from the raw_data into Envoy class data used by the Home Assistant integration. This is a subset of the full raw dataset.

##### Envoy entities by device

Shows all entities created by the integration based on the findings of the initial scan, grouped by device. Entity state based on the last data collection cycle is included. State values here come from the Envoy model data and are the values visible in the dashboards.

##### Fixtures

The data to build test fixtures from. This section is only available when the option to Collect test fixture data is enabled in the integration [options](#options).
