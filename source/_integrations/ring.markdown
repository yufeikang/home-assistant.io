The Ring integration allows you to integrate your [Ring.com](https://ring.com/) devices in Home Assistant. Due to recent authentication changes of Ring, you will need to run at least Home Assistant 0.104.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- [Binary sensor](#binary-sensor)
- [Button](#button)
- [Camera](#camera)
  - [Saving the videos captured by your Ring Door Bell](#saving-the-videos-captured-by-your-ring-door-bell)
- [Event](#event)
- [Sensor](#sensor)
- [Siren](#siren)
- [Switch](#switch)
- [Light](#light)
- [Number](#number)

{% note %}
This integration does NOT allow for live viewing of your Ring camera within Home Assistant.
{% endnote %}

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

## Binary sensor

The binary sensor switches off and on when motion, doorbell rings, and intercom unlock events occur.

The binary sensor is being replaced with the event entity, and you should migrate any automations to the event entity by release 2025.4.0.

## Button

Once you have enabled the [Ring integration](/integrations/ring), you can start using the button platform. Currently, it supports intercom to open the door.

## Camera

{% important %}
Please note that downloading and playing Ring video will require a Ring Protect plan.
{% endimportant %}

Once you have enabled the [Ring integration](/integrations/ring), you can start using the camera platform. Currently, it supports doorbell and stickup cameras.

### Saving the videos captured by your Ring Door Bell

You can save locally the latest video captured by your Ring Door Bell using the [downloader](/integrations/downloader) along with either an [automation](/integrations/automation) or [python_script](/integrations/python_script). First, enable the [downloader](/integrations/downloader) integration in your configuration by adding the following to your `configuration.yaml`.

```yaml
downloader:
  download_dir: downloads
```

Then you can use the following automation, with the entities from your system, which will save the video file under `<config>/downloads/<camera_name>/<camera_name>/`:

{% raw %}

```yaml
automation:
  alias: "Save the video when the doorbell is pushed"
  triggers:
  - trigger: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.front_doorbell_ding
    to: "on"
  actions:
  - action: downloader.download_file
    data:
      url: "{{ state_attr('camera.front_door', 'video_url') }}"
      subdir: "{{state_attr('camera.front_door', 'friendly_name')}}"
      filename: "{{state_attr('camera.front_door', 'friendly_name')}}"
```

{% endraw %}

You may consider some modifications in the subdirectory and the filename to suit your needs. For example, you can add the date and the time and extension to the downloaded file:

{% raw %}
```yaml
    data:
      url: "{{ state_attr('camera.front_door', 'video_url') }}"
      subdir: "{{ state_attr('camera.front_door', 'friendly_name') }}/{{ now().strftime('%Y.%m') }}"
      filename: "{{ now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d-at-%H-%M-%S') }}.mp4"
```
{% endraw %}

the above modification will save the video file under `<config>/downloads/<camera_name>/YYYY-MM/YYYY-MM-DD-at-HH-MM-SS.mp4`. You can change the date according to your localization format.

If you want to use `python_script`, enable it your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file first:

```yaml
python_script:
```

You can then use the following `python_script` to save the video file:

```python
# obtain ring doorbell camera object
# replace the camera.front_door by your camera entity
ring_cam = hass.states.get("camera.front_door")

subdir_name = f"ring_{ring_cam.attributes.get('friendly_name')}"

# get video URL
data = {
    "url": ring_cam.attributes.get("video_url"),
    "subdir": subdir_name,
    "filename": ring_cam.attributes.get("friendly_name"),
}

# call downloader integration to save the video
hass.services.call("downloader", "download_file", data)
```

## Event

The event entity captures events like doorbell rings, motion alerts, and intercom unlocking.

### Realtime event stability

Home Assistant requires outbound TCP access to port 5228 to connect to Ring's real-time event service.
Ensure your firewall and network configuration allow this connection.

Below are steps to follow if realtime events are not working.

#### Step 1

Issues with Ring alerts may be caused by having too many authenticated devices on your Ring account. Before version 2023.12.0, the Home Assistant Ring integration would register a new entry in `Authorized Client Devices` in the `Control Center` at [ring.com](https://account.ring.com/account/control-center/authorized-devices) on every restart.
{% warning %}
When cleaning up devices:
1. Only delete entries that start with `ring-doorbell:HomeAssistant` or `Python`
2. Do NOT delete entries for your phones or other Ring apps
3. If there are too many devices to delete individually, you can use the `Remove all devices` option, but you'll need to re-authorize all your devices afterward
{% endwarning %}

#### Step 2

If you're still experiencing issues after Step 1, try generating a new unique ID for the Home Assistant Ring integration instance.
To do this, click the three-dot menu on the integration entry and select the `Reconfigure` option.
Do not try this step before clearing down all the excess `Authorized Client Devices` as per Step 1, or it will simply invalidate the reconfigured entry.

#### Step 3

If alerts are still not working after Steps 1 and 2, try toggling the Motion Warning setting:

1. Go to [ring.com](https://ring.com) and sign in
2. Select your device
3. Navigate to Device Settings
4. Find the Motion Warning toggle
5. Turn it off, wait 30 seconds
6. Turn it back on

This has successfully restored alerts for many users.

## Sensor

Once you have enabled the [Ring integration](/integrations/ring), you can start using the sensor platform. Currently, it supports battery level and Wi-Fi signal.

The volume sensors are being replaced with the number entity which allows setting the volume. You should migrate any automations using the volume sensors to the number entity by release 2025.4.0.

## Siren

- Adds a siren entity for every camera that supports a siren. Note the siren will only turn on for 30 seconds before automatically turning off.
- Adds a siren entity for chimes to play the test sound.

## Switch

Once you have enabled the [Ring integration](/integrations/ring), you can start using the switch platform.

- Motion detection - Switches motion detection on and off for cameras.
- In-home chime - Switches on and off a mechanical or digital chime connected to a ring doorbell.

## Light

Once you have enabled the [Ring integration](/integrations/ring), you can start using the light platform. This will add a light for every camera that supports a light (such as a floodlight).

## Number

Once you have enabled the [Ring integration](/integrations/ring), you can start using the number platform.
Currently, it supports showing and setting the volume of the doorbell/chime ring, intercom voice volume, and intercom microphone volume.
