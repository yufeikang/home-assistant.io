Integration for the [HomeWizard Energy](https://www.homewizard.com) platform. It can collect data locally from the HomeWizard Energy products and create them as sensors in Home Assistant. Use this integration to monitor your energy, gas and water usage to optimize your energy consumption. The information collected by this integration can be used by the [Energy dashboard](/home-energy-management).

## Supported devices

- [Wi-Fi P1 Meter](https://www.homewizard.com/p1-meter): Sensors for power import/export, energy consumption (single or three phases), and information about your smart meter and gas (model: `HWE-P1`).
- [Wi-Fi Energy Socket](https://www.homewizard.com/energy-socket): Sensors for power import/export and energy consumption, and switches for controlling the outlet (model: `HWE-SKT`).
- [Wi-Fi Watermeter](https://www.homewizard.com/watermeter): Sensors for active and total water usage (model: `HWE-WTR`).
- [Wi-Fi kWh Meter](https://www.homewizard.com/kwh-meter): Sensors for power import/export and energy consumption (models: `HWE-KWH1`, `HWE-KWH3`, `SDM230-wifi`, and `SDM630-wifi`.).

## Enable the API

You have to enable the local API to allow Home Assistant to communicate with your device. Do this in the HomeWizard Energy app:

  1. Go to Settings (gear icon in the upper-right).
  2. Go to 'Meters'.
  3. Select your device.
  4. Scroll down and turn on 'Local API'.

## Sensors

Sensors for the P1 meter, Energy Socket, and kWh meter:

- **Energy import/export (kWh)**: Total energy imported or exported since installation. Each tariff has its own sensor (e.g., T1, T2) and a sensor for the combined value.
- **Power (W)**: Active power that is measured on each phase.

Sensors for P1 meter, only available when the smart meter exposes these values:

- **Gas usage (m³)**: Total gas used since the installation of the gas meter. A gas meter sends its measurement once every 5 minutes or per hour, depending on the version of the smart meter.
- **Tariff**: Current tariff that is used. Can be used to keep consumption as low as possible during peak hours.
- **Voltage (V)**: Active voltage measured on each phase.
- **Current (A)**: Active current measured on each phase.
- **Frequency (Hz)**: Net frequency.
- **Voltage sags and swells**: Number of times a voltage sag or swell has been detected.
- **Power failures**: Two sensors indicate the number of power failures detected by the smart meter. One for all power failures and another for 'long' power failures.
- **Peak demand**: Belgium users are starting to get charged for the peak usage per month (see [capaciteitstarief](https://www.fluvius.be/thema/factuur-en-tarieven/capaciteitstarief)). Two sensors are available: one shows the current quarterly average, and another shows the peak measured this month. Both sensors are provided directly from the smart meter and can be used to keep the peak as low as possible.

Sensors for Energy Socket and kWh meter:

- **Voltage (V)**: Active voltage measured on each phase.
- **Current (A)**: Active current measured on each phase.
- **Frequency (Hz)**: Net frequency.
- **Reactive power (VAR)**: Active reactive power measurement on each phase.
- **Apparent power (VA)**: Active apparent power measurement on each phase.

Sensors for Water meter:

- **Water usage (L/min)**: Flow of water measured at that time.
- **Total water usage (m³)**: Total water usage since the installation of the HomeWizard Water meter.

## Energy Socket

The Energy Socket outlet state and status light can be controlled. There are two switches:

- **Switch**: Controls the outlet state of the Energy Socket. This switch is permanently on when _Switch Lock_ is turned on. Use this to control the power of simple devices, such as a heater or a charger.
- **Switch lock**: Forces the outlet state to the _on_ position and disables the physical button. This option is useful when the socket is used for a device that must not be turned off, such as a refrigerator.

You can also control the green status light brightness with **Status light brightness**. This light turns on when the switch is on.

## Identify

The identify button can be pressed to let the status light blink for a few seconds.
_This feature is not available for the kWh Meter._

## Cloud communication

The HomeWizard Energy devices are designed to work with the HomeWizard Energy app and require communication with the HomeWizard cloud to function with the app. The "Cloud connection" configuration toggle can be used to turn off all communication with the HomeWizard cloud, making the device fully local. The device cannot communicate with the app, and the device won't receive any future firmware updates.

Cloud communication is restored when the switch is turned on again. Cloud communications are also restored after a factory reset, or when the device is put in pairing mode.

After deleting the integration, go to the HomeWizard Energy app and disable the local API if no other integrations are using it.

## Examples

### Send a notification when your washing machine is done

If you know the energy characteristics of your washing machine, you can create an automation that sends a notification when the energy usage drops below a certain threshold. This can notify you when your washing machine is done. You can use the following blueprint for this:

- [Appliance Power Monitor Blueprint With Elapsed Time and Energy Used Variables](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/appliance-power-monitor-blueprint-with-elapsed-time-and-energy-used-variables/549073), created by [@Jhonattan-Souza](https://community.home-assistant.io/u/jhonattan-souza)

## Data fetching interval

The integration is {% term polling %} new data every 5 seconds. There is no limitation on the number or frequency of requests that can be made to the device.

{% include integrations/remove_device_service.md %}

## Known limitations

### Watermeter cannot be used with batteries

The Water meter can be powered via a USB-C cable and with batteries. When using batteries, it only connects to Wi-Fi every couple of hours. Because of this, the API can only be used when powered via the USB-C cable. It is not possible to use this integration when the water meter is powered by batteries.

### P1 Meter may update slowly

The P1 Meter is updated by the smart meter, which usually updates every 1 or 10 seconds. This means that the P1 Meter may not update as fast as the other devices.

## Troubleshooting

### My device is not showing up

It may happen that you can't find your devices or they won't show up in the integration setup. This can be caused by the following:

- The device is not connected to the network. You have to connect your new device to the network first via the HomeWizard Energy app.
- Make sure you have updated the device to the latest firmware. Follow this guide to learn how to update your device: [How do I check if I have the latest software on my HomeWizard product?](https://helpdesk.homewizard.com/en/articles/9167578-how-do-i-check-if-i-have-the-latest-software-on-my-homewizard-product)
- Make sure you have enabled the local API in device settings via the HomeWizard Energy app.
- Make sure both Home Assistant and the device are on the same network.
