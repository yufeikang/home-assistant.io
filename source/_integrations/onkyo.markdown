The `onkyo` {% term integration %} allows you to control [Onkyo](https://www.onkyo.com) and [Integra](http://www.integrahometheater.com) (from 2011 onward) and also [Pioneer](https://www.pioneerelectronics.com) (from 2016 onward) receivers using Home Assistant.
Please be aware that you need to enable "Network Standby" for this integration to work with your hardware.

Host:
  description: Hostname or IP address of the device, for example:`192.168.1.2`.

Volume Resolution:
  description: Number of steps it takes for the receiver to go from the lowest to the highest possible volume. Possible values are 50, 80, 100, 200. For older Onkyo receivers, this typically is 80; newer Onkyo receivers use 200.

{% configuration_basic %}
Max Volume:
  description: Maximum volume limit as a percentage. Often the maximum volume of the receiver is far too loud. Setting this will set Home Assistant's 100% volume to be this setting on the amp, i.e., if you set this to 50%, when you set Home Assistant to be 100%, then your receiver will be set to 50% of its maximum volume.
  default: 100

### Zones

If your receiver has a second or third zone available, they are displayed as additional media players with functionality similar to the main zone.

### Action `onkyo_select_hdmi_output`

Changes HDMI output of your receiver

| Data attribute | Optional | Description                                                     |
| ---------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `entity_id`            | no       | String or list of a single `entity_id` that will change output. |
| `hdmi_output`          | no       | The desired output code.                                        |

Accepted values are:
'no', 'analog', 'yes', 'out', 'out-sub', 'sub', 'hdbaset', 'both', 'up'
which one to use seems to vary depending on model so you will have to try them out.
( For model TX-NR676E it seems to be 'out' for main, 'out-sub' for sub, and 'sub' for both )

### Example `onkyo_select_hdmi_output` script

```yaml
# Example onkyo_select_hdmi_output script
#
script:
  hdmi_sub:
    alias: "Hdmi out projector"
    sequence:
      - action: media_player.onkyo_select_hdmi_output
        data:
          entity_id: media_player.onkyo
          hdmi_output: out-sub
```

### Example `play_media` script

The `play_media` function can be used in script to play radio station by preset number.
Not working for NET radio.

```yaml
# Example play_media script
#
script:
  radio1:
    alias: "Radio 1"
    sequence:
      - action: media_player.turn_on
        target:
          entity_id: media_player.onkyo
      - action: media_player.play_media
        target:
          entity_id: media_player.onkyo
        data:
          media_content_type: "radio"
          media_content_id: "1"
```
