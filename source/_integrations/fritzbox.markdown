The AVM FRITZ!SmartHome integration for Home Assistant allows you to integrate [AVM Smart Home](https://en.avm.de/products/smart-home/) (_former AVM FRITZ!DECT_) devices like plugs, thermostats or shutter drivers as also trigger so called smart home templates (_contains settings for Smart Home devices of the same type_).

## Prerequisites

It is recommended to create a separate user to connect Home Assistant to your FRITZ!Box. To create a user, in the FRITZ!Box go to **System** > **FRITZ!Box Users** > **Users** > **Add User**. Make sure the user has the **Smart Home** permission.

{% note %}
If you still want to use the predefined user, please note that as of FRITZ!OS 7.24, the FRITZ!Box creates a random username for the admin user if you didn't set one yourself. This can be found after logging into the FRITZ!Box and visit **System** > **FRITZ!Box Users** > **Users**. The username starts with `fritz` followed by four random numbers. Under properties on the right it says `created automatically`. Prior to FRITZ!OS 7.24, the default username was `admin`.

## Data fetching and limitations

Since the API of the FRITZ!Box does not provide a push mechanism, this integration polls the data every 30 seconds from the FRITZ!Box. Because of this, the integration can't support the main features of event-based devices like the [FRITZ!DECT 350][fritzdect_350] door/window contact sensors or the [FRITZ!DECT 440][fritzdect_440] buttons (_see the [other devices](#other-devices) section for details_).

## Devices

### Light bulbs

Light bulbs like the [FRITZ!DECT 500][fritzdect_500] or [Magenta SmartHome LED E27 Color][magenta_led_e27_color] will be integrated as {% term light %} entities.

{% note %}
The [FRITZ!DECT 500][fritzdect_500] light bulb supports only 36 colors. When a color is picked in Home Assistant that is not supported by the device, a color that comes close will be activated.
{% endnote %}

### Plugs

Plugs like the [FRITZ!DECT 200][fritzdect_200] or [FRITZ!DECT 210][fritzdect_210] will be integrated as {% term switch %} entities.

Further there are additional {% term sensor %} and {% term binary_sensor "binary sensor" %} entities created for each device, based on its capabilities:

- Button lock via UI
- Button lock on device
- Electric Current
- Power Consumption
- Temperature
- Total Energy
- Voltage

### Shutter drivers

Shutter drivers like the [Rademacher RolloTron DECT 1213][rademacher_rollotron_dect_1213] will be integrated as {% term cover %} entities.

### Templates

Self defined [templates](https://en.avm.de/guide/three-smart-home-templates-that-will-make-your-life-easier) within the FRITZ!Box smart home configuration menu, will be integrated as {% term button %} entities and those can be triggered from within Home Assistant.

### Thermostats

Thermostats like the [FRITZ!DECT 301][fritzdect_301], [FRITZ!DECT 302][fritzdect_302] or [Eurotronic Comet DECT][eurotronic_comet_dect] will be integrated as {% term climate %} entities.

These entities can have several attributes that can be useful for {% term automations %} and {% term templates %}:

| Attribute | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `battery_low` | The low battery state indication. |
| `battery_level` | The battery level (only available since Fritz!OS 7). |
| `holiday_mode` | The state of the holiday mode (only available since Fritz!OS 7). |
| `summer_mode` | The state of the summer mode (only available since Fritz!OS 7). |
| `window_open` | The state of the window open detection (only available since Fritz!OS 7). |

Further there are additional {% term sensor %} and {% term binary_sensor "binary sensor" %} entities created for each device, based on its capabilities:

- Battery
- Button lock via UI
- Button lock on device
- Comfort Temperature
- Current Scheduled Preset
- Eco Temperature
- Next Scheduled Change Time
- Next Scheduled Preset
- Next Scheduled Temperature

### Other devices

Some devices like the [FRITZ!DECT 350][fritzdect_350] or the [FRITZ!DECT 440][fritzdect_440] can't be controlled via this integration, but its sensors can still be integrated.

The availability of these {% term sensor %} and {% term binary_sensor "binary sensor" %} entities depends on the features and capabilities of the connected device and can be one or multiple of:

- Battery
- Button lock via UI
- Button lock on device
- Humidity
- Temperature

## Troubleshooting

In any case, when reporting an issue, please enable [debug logging](/docs/configuration/troubleshooting/#debug-logs-and-diagnostics), restart the integration, and as soon as the issue re-occurs stop the debug logging again (_download of debug log file will start automatically_). Further _if still possible_, please also download the [diagnostics](/integrations/diagnostics) data. If you have collected the debug log and the diagnostics data, provide them with the issue report.

## Remove the integration

{% include integrations/remove_device_service.md %}

If you don't use the separate created FRITZ!Box user anymore, than remove it from the FRITZ!Box under to **System** > **FRITZ!Box Users** > **Users**.
