The Habitica {% term integration %} enables you to monitor your adventurer's progress and stats from [Habitica](https://habitica.com/) in Home Assistant and seamlessly integrates your to-do's, daily tasks, and many more things.

## About Habitica

Habitica is a gamified task manager and habit tracker that turns your daily goals and to-dos into a role-playing game, helping you stay motivated and productive while earning rewards and leveling up your avatar.

## How you can use this integration

The Habitica integration lets you automate task management, such as creating to-dos when appliances finish or marking dailies complete using smart sensors. You can visualize tasks and stats in Home Assistant dashboards or create notifications for due tasks, keeping you organized and on track with your goals.

## Prerequisites for Habitica integration

- To set up the Habitica integration, you must first have an active Habitica account. You can register for an account at [Habitica.com](https://habitica.com/).
- During the setup process in Home Assistant, you can choose between two login options:
  - "Login to Habitica", which allows you to log in with your *username* or *email* and *password*.
  - "Login to other instances", which requires your `User ID` and `API Token`. The `User ID` and `API Token` can be retrieved by logging into your Habitica account, navigating to the **Settings** menu, and selecting **Site Data**.
  - Additionally, you will need to provide the URL for the Habitica instance you wish to connect to; the default URL is `https://habitica.com`, but you can specify a different URL if you are using an alternative Habitica instance or a self-hosted instance.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

## Sensors

- **Class**: Indicates the class of your character (Warrior, Rogue, Healer, or Mage).
- **Display name**:  Shows the character's display name.
- **Experience**: Displays the current experience points of the character (for example, "144 XP").
- **Gold**: Shows the amount of gold owned by your character (for example, "22.29 GP").
- **Health**: Shows the current health points of the character (for example, "42 HP").
- **Level**: Displays the current level of the character.
- **Mana**: Displays the current mana points of your character (for example, "61 MP").
- **Max. mana**: Indicates the maximum mana points your character can have at the current level (for example, "70 MP").
- **Next level**: Indicates the remaining experience points needed to reach the next level (for example, "440 XP").
- **Ha Dispbits**: Shows the number of habits being tracked (for example, "4 tasks").
- **Rewards**:lays the rewards that can be redeemed (for example, "1 task")
- **Gems**: Shows the total number of gems currently owned by your Habitica character, used for purchasing items and customizations.
- **Mystic hourglasses**: Displays the number of mystic hourglasses earned as a subscriber, which can be redeemed for exclusive items from past events.
- **Strength, intelligence, constitution, perception**: Display your character's attribute points (stats). The sensors' attributes provide a breakdown of contributions from level, battle gear, class equip bonus, allocation, and buffs.

## Binary sensors

- **Pending quest invitation**: Indicates if you have an invitation to a quest awaiting your response.
  
## To-do lists

The following Habitica tasks are available as to-do lists in Home Assistant. You can add, delete, edit and check-off completed tasks

- **To-Do's**: Displays a comprehensive list of active and completed to-dos. Each to-do includes its due date if applicable, allowing you to check them off, edit them, delete them, and create new to-dos seamlessly.
- **Dailies**: Shows the daily tasks that need to be completed today or in the future. Tasks completed yesterday can still be marked off as "yesterdailies" until a new day starts.

## Calendars

- **To-Do calendar:** Lists the due dates for all active to-do tasks. Each event on this calendar represents a to-do item that has a set due date, making it easy to track upcoming deadlines and plan accordingly.
- **Dailies calendar:** Displays all daily tasks that are scheduled for today and are still active. It also shows all tasks scheduled for future dates, helping you stay organized and track upcoming routines. The calendar sensor will be active if there are unfinished tasks for today and display the next due daily (based on sort order if there are multiple tasks due for that day).
- **To-Do reminders calendar**: Lists events for reminders associated with your to-dos in Habitica, helping you track when notifications for specific to-dos are expected.
- **Dailies reminders calendar**: Shows events for reminders linked to your Habitica dailies, ensuring you know when notifications for your dailies will occur.

## Button controls

- **Start my day**: Initiates daily routine actions in Habitica, including resetting your dailies, deal damage from unfinished dailies and quest bosses, habits adjustment, buff expiration, and mana regeneration based on completed dailies.
- **Revive from death**: Allows your character to revive from death in Habitica. Upon revival, HP is fully restored, but your character will lose all gold, 1 level, all experience points, one stat point, and one piece of equipment.
- **Buy a health potion**: Allows your character to purchase a health potion in Habitica. Instantly applies the potion upon purchase, healing 15 HP at a cost of 25 GP.

{% my blueprint_import badge blueprint_url="https://community.home-assistant.io/t/habitica-auto-accept-quest-invitation/791002" %}

{% details "Example YAML configuration" %}

{% raw %}

```yaml
triggers:
  - trigger: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.habitica_pending_quest_invitation
    from: "off"
    to: "on"
actions:
  - action: habitica.accept_quest
    data:
      config_entry: config_entry_id
    response_variable: action_response
  - action: notify.persistent_notification
    data:
      title: You have been invited to a quest!
      message: >-
        ![{{action_response["key"]}}](https://habitica-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/mobileApp/images/inventory_quest_scroll_{{action_response["key"]}}.png)

        The invitation has been accepted, and the quest {% if
        action_response["active"] %}has already started{% else %}is waiting
        for other party members to join{% endif %}.
```

{% endraw %}

{% enddetails %}

{% note %}
When creating automations, be mindful of the [rate limits](#known-limitations). Frequent triggers or multiple concurrent automations can quickly exceed the allowed number of requests.
{% endnote %}

### Create "Empty the dishwasher" to-do

Automatically create a Habitica to-do when the dishwasher finishes its cycle.

{% my blueprint_import badge blueprint_url="https://community.home-assistant.io/t/habitica-create-to-do-when-dishwasher-finishes-its-cycle/786625" %}

{% my blueprint_import badge blueprint_url="https://community.home-assistant.io/t/habitica-complete-toothbrushing-tasks-on-your-habitica-dailies-list/786631" %}

{% details "Example YAML configuration" %}

```yaml
triggers:
  - trigger: state
    entity_id: sensor.oralb_toothbrush_state
    to: "running"
    for:
      hours: 0
      minutes: 0
      seconds: 10 # Time delay for debouncing to avoid false triggers
actions:
  - choose:
      - conditions:
          - condition: time
            after: "05:00:00"
            before: "12:00:00"
        sequence:
          - action: todo.update_item
            data:
              item: "Brush your teeth in the morning 🪥"
              status: completed

              status: completed
            target:
              entity_id: todo.habitica_dailies
```

{% enddetails %}

## Templating

`sensor.habitica_USER_habits` and `sensor.habitica_USER_rewards` have state attributes listing the user's respective tasks. For example, you can see this information in **{% my developer_states title="Developer Tools > States" %}** under `sensor.habitica_USER_habits` > **Attributes**, or by adding a [Markdown card](/dashboards/markdown/) to a dashboard with the following code:

{% raw %}

```jinja
{% for key, value in states.sensor.habitica_USER_habits.attributes.items() %}
  {% if 'text' in value | string %}
    {{ loop.index }}. {{ value.text }}
  {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
```

{% endraw %}

## Data updates

This integration retrieves data from Habitica every 60 seconds to ensure timely updates.

## Known limitations

Habitica imposes a rate limit of 30 requests per minute for third-party applications, which applies collectively to all tools and integrations you use.

This integration performs the following requests:

- 3 requests per data update (every 60 seconds).
- 1 request per action, such as executing skills or interacting with to-dos and dailies.
- 1 additional request 5 seconds after an action to sync the data with Habitica.

Please keep these limits in mind to avoid exceeding Habitica's request allowance. Efforts are ongoing to optimize the integration and reduce the number of requests it makes.

## Remove integration

This integration can be removed by following these steps:

{% include integrations/remove_device_service.md %}
