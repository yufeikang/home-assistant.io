## Better backups!

This release brings big updates to the backup system in Home Assistant. We have
fully revamped the whole backup experience and added a lot of new features to
make it easier to use, but more importantly, it will provide you with a lot
more ease of mind when it comes to your backups.

So, without further ado, let's dive into the new backup system!

### Automated backups 🤖

Yes! You've read that title correctly! Home Assistant now has the ability to
automatically create backups for you on a configurable frequency!

This is a major improvement for the backup system, as it will now ensure you
always have a recent backup available, without you having to worry about it.

<img class="no-shadow" alt="The new backup overview page shows you exactly when your last backup took place" src="/images/blog/2025-01/temp-backup-window.png" />

When you now navigate to your backups in the setting screen, you will be
greeted with a new overview page that shows you exactly when your last backup
took place, and when the next one is scheduled. Instant peace of mind!

That said, if anything does go wrong while creating a backup, Home Assistant
will raise an issue in the repair center to ensure you are aware of it.

### Encrypted backups by default 🔒

All backups are now encrypted by default. Previously, it was possible to
optionally set a password for your backups. However, this was not enforced and
could be skipped.

As of this release, we've prioritized the security of your backups and have
replaced the optional password with a mandatory encryption key. This key is
required to restore your ([AES-128] encrypted) backups, and it is essential to
keep it safe and ensure your privacy is protected.

<img class="no-shadow" alt="The new backup overview page shows you exactly when your last backup took place" src="/images/blog/2025-01/temp-backup-encryption-key.png" />

The first time when you set up your backups, and encryption key will be
generated for you. Make sure to store this key in a safe place, as you will
need it to restore your backups. To make this easier, you can download the
encryption key as an emergency kit directly when you set up your backups,
but you can also download it at any time from the backup settings page.

[AES-128]: https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard

### Home Assistant Cloud backups 😎

Are you a Home Assistant Cloud by Nabu Casa subscriber? Then you're in for a
treat! You can now store your latest encrypted backup in your Home Assistant
Cloud account storage up to 5GB!

**This feature is added to all existing and new Home Assistant Cloud
subscribers without any additional costs! 🎁**

<img class="no-shadow" alt="Home Assistant Cloud is now a backup target location, that is included with the Home Assistant Cloud subscription" src="/images/blog/2025-01/temp-backup-home-assistant-cloud.png" />

So not only, are your backups automatically created and encrypted, but also
automatically uploaded to an off-site location for you, ensuring you always
have a safe backup available.

The backup can be downloaded from Home Assistant itself, but also from the
Home Assistant Cloud account page @ Nabu Casa in case you need it.

Again, make sure to keep your encryption key safe, as you will need it to
restore your backups. The encryption key is not stored anywhere else, not even
in Home Assistant Cloud, to ensure your privacy is protected.

### Backup locations are extendable by design 🧩

So, automated backup can be backed up to your local disk to Home Assistant
Cloud, but what if you want to store your backups somewhere else?

As one expects from Home Assistant, we want to make everything as flexible as
possible without any vendor lock-in. Therefore, the backup system is designed
to be extendable, meaning integrations can now provide additional backup
locations.

Right now, everything is brand new ✨ **no integrations provide this yet**, but
we are sure we see more integrations providing backup locations in the future.
Integration could provide a backup location to store backups on a, for example,
a NAS, Google Drive, Backblaze B2, or any other storage provider.

Choice is an important aspect of Home Assistant, and this is how we have made
that aspect count for the backup system as well.

### Backup retention 🗑

Our previous backup system would just make backups, which was good, but...
eventually you'd annoyingly run out of disk space. 😬

So! Backup retention is now a thing! You can now configure how many backups you
want to keep, and the system will automatically clean up old backups for you.

<img class="no-shadow" alt="You can now configure a retention policy for your backups, allowing Home Assistant to clean it up automatically" src="/images/blog/2025-01/temp-backup-retention.png" />

### Setting up backups for the first time 🚀

When you navigate to the backup settings for the first time after upgrading
to this release, you will be greeted with a new setup wizard that will guide
you through the process of setting up your backups in the new system.

The wizard will help you set up your encryption key, configure your backup
frequency, and set up your backup retention policy. And when it is ready, it
will immediately kick off your first backup!

All set! One less thing to worry about 🎉

## Month of "What the Heck?!"

We had the Month of "What the Heck?!" in December, and it was a blast! 🎉
Thanks to all the contributors who participated in this event, raising all
your "What the Heck?!" moments with Home Assistant.

All input from it is very valuable to us, and we are working on using it to
shape the future of Home Assistant, for example, by determining what areas
impact our roadmaps and priorities.

Besides that, quite a bunch of shared "What the Heck?!" moments have been
addressed in this release already 🚀

While the month is over, the work is not! We expect to see many more results
from this month over the upcoming releases.

### Setting category and labels when creating automations and scripts

For the first WTH item that has been resolved, we have [@jpbede] to thank!
And this one, is one of the higher voted ones as well, so it is a good one!
Andrew Jackson wrote:

[_**"WTH can you not add categories, labels etc when creating an automation"**_](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/wth-can-you-not-add-categories-labels-etc-when-creating-an-automation/802562)

Yeah, that is a good WTH! Every time you create a new automation or script,
you probably want to organize it right away, and not having to go back to
the settings to do so. **FIXED**! 🎉

<img class="no-shadow" alt="If you press the d on your keyboard, it will pop up the Quickbar for devices." src="/images/blog/2025-01/temp-new-automation-labels.png" />

When you create a new automation or script, and also when renaming it,
you can now set the category and labels right away! 🏷️ Nice!

### Quickly navigate to a device

You might be aware, that you can bring up our quick navigation bar anywhere in
Home Assistant, by pressing the `c` key on your keyboard to navigate to various
places and the `e` key to search and navigate to any entity. However...

[_**"WTH is there no quick bar for devices?"**_](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/wth-is-there-no-quick-bar-for-devices/802310)

Well, that is a good question that Andreas Brett raised! There is indeed no
such thing for devices. [@jpbede] to the rescue! As of this release, you
can navigate to any device using the quickbar by pressing the `d` key on your
keyboard.

<img class="no-shadow" alt="If you press the d on your keyboard, it will pop up the Quickbar for devices." src="/images/blog/2025-01/391675502-36f624b7-786f-486b-89a6-e86bc0a5f9fc.png"/>

## Zooom & Pan for charts

KNXBroker raised the the following WTH topic:

[_**"WTH lets upgrade History Graphs"**_](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/wth-lets-upgrade-history-graphs/802568)

You are right! The history graphs in Home Assistant are a bit basic but
functional! Nevertheless, we can do better! 🚀

One of the bigger items in that WTH topic, was the ability to zoom and pan...
Well, thanks to [@MindFreeze], you can now zoom and pan in any graph in Home
Assistant! 📈

<img class="no-shadow" alt="Zoom any graph in Home Assistant, by holding ctrl or command and scroll your mouse wheel!" src="/images/blog/2025-01/temp-zoom-graphs.gif"/>

Hold control (or command on macOS) and scroll to zoom in and out using your
mouse. You can also click and drag to pan around the zoomed graph.

Besides this change, [@MindFreeze] enabled small micro-animation for the
history graphs, making them look a bit more alive and less static.

[@MindFreeze]: https://github.com/MindFreeze

### Controlling the default exposure of new entities to Assist

mathd made the following point in a Month of "What the Heck?!" topic:

[_"WTH Are all new entities exposed to Assist by default?"_](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/wth-are-all-new-entities-exposed-to-assist-by-default/803889)

We hear you! Thanks to [@jpbede], you can now control the default exposure of
new entities to Assist. You can now toggle this on or off in the Home Assistant
Voice Assistant settings.

<img class="no-shadow" alt="Zoom any graph in Home Assistant, by holding ctrl or command and scroll your mouse wheel!" src="/images/blog/2025-01/temp-assist-expose-default.png" />

### Reordering individual devices on the energy dashboard

[_**"WTH Is in Energy Dashboard the individual devices not able to reorder"**_](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/wth-is-in-energy-dashboard-the-individual-devices-not-able-to-reorder/805051)

Thanks for that one yormedia! Honestly, this one has been raised in previous
editions of the Month of "What the Heck?!" a few times as well. Reason enough
for [@karwosts] to pick this up and make it happen! You can now reorder the
individual devices on the energy dashboard! 🔡

<img class="no-shadow" alt="If you press the d on your keyboard, it will pop up the Quickbar for devices." src="/images/blog/2025-01/temp-sortable-devices.gif"/>

### More "What the Heck?!" improvements

There are many more smaller improvements originating from the Month of "What the
Heck?!" in this release. Here are some of the other noteworthy ones:

[_**"WTH there is no hotkey for Assist"**_](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/wth-there-is-no-hotkey-for-assist/802403)**

Well, thanks to [@jpbede] you can now press the `a` on your keyboard anywhere
in Home Assistant to summon Assist! 🎙️ Nice!

[_**"WTH doesn't HA ask if I want to save automations?"**_](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/wth-doesnt-ha-ask-if-i-want-to-save-automations/804030)

Whoa! That is a good one! Thanks to [@jpbede], Home Assistant will now ask you
if you want to save your automation before leaving the editor if there are
unsaved changes. 🤖

[_**"WTH Can't I filter labels within a table filter?"**_](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/wth-cant-i-filter-labels-within-a-table-filter/802529)

Good question. If you have a lot of labels, scrolling through the list of labels
in the filter option, can be a bit cumbersome. Thanks to [@silamon], you can
now search and filter through the labels in the filter option! 🔎

[_**WTH sentence trigger doesn't contain any context**_](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/wth-sentence-trigger-doesnt-contain-any-context/802386)

Great idea! Thanks to [@balloob], the full conversation input is now available
to sentence triggers! 🗣️ This was actually the first WTH item to be resolved
this edition! 😎

[Lorem ipsum]: /integrations/lorem_ipsum

{% enddetails %}

### Now available to set up from the UI

While most {% term integrations %} can be set up directly from the Home Assistant
user interface, some were only available using YAML configuration. We keep moving
more integrations to the UI, making them more accessible for everyone
to set up and use.

The following integration is now available via the Home Assistant UI:

- **[Niko Home Control]**, done by [@VandeurenGlenn]

[@VandeurenGlenn]: https://github.com/VandeurenGlenn
[Niko Home Control]: /integrations/niko_home_control

### Farewell to the following

The following {% term integrations %} are also no longer available as
of this release:

- **DTE Energy Bridge** has been removed after deprecated. The integration
  was no longer functional.
- **Simulated** has been previously deprecated and now removed.
- **Stookalert** has been removed. The upstream data is no longer updated.
  The [Stookwijzer] integration is a good alternative to get the same information.

[Stookwijzer]: /integrations/stookwijzer

## Other noteworthy changes

There are many more improvements in this release; here are some of the other
noteworthy changes this release:

- When viewing data tables and using `ctrl+f` in your browser to search, the
  search input will now be focused automatically. As native browser search
  will not work on data tables. Thanks [@jpbede]!
- [@marcinbauer85] adjust the "Add card" dialog, to automatically focus on the
  search field when you add a card and can start typing to search right
  away! Nice touch!
- Images uploaded through Home Assistant (for exmaple, as background or as
  an user profile picture), as now browsable in the media browser. Thanks
  [@karwosts]!
- The unit of measurment is now shown next to the numeric slider in the
  more-info dialog of number entities. Thanks [@abmantis]!
- Home Assistant now support `mWh` as a unit of measurement for energy sensors
  and `mW` for electrical potential power sensors. Thanks [@agners]!
- [@wendevlin] added settings and category overflow actions to the automation
  and script editor (the three dotted menu in the top right corner), making
  it easier to access those straight from the editor. Nice!
- The [logbook card] can supports picking a target for things it should show
  events for. This means, you can now pick based on entities, devices, areas,
  floors, and labels! Thanks, [@silamon]!

## Dashboard background settings

A few releases ago, we made it easier to add a background image to your
dashboard. This release, [@silamon] takes it a step further by adding
a lot of settings to customize how the background image is displayed.

This includes support for tiled backgrounds, transparency, size settings,
alignment, and allowing the background to scroll with the page or stay fixed.

_**TODO**: Add screenshot_

Nice! Thanks, [@silamon]!

[@silamon]: https://github.com/silamon

## Media player volume feature for Tile card

A super nice addition from [@simon-zumbrunnen]! The Tile card now supports a
media player volume slider feature. This feature allows you to control the
volume of a media player directly from the Tile card. Nice work Simon!

## Backward-incompatible changes

We do our best to avoid making changes to existing functionality that might
unexpectedly impact your Home Assistant installation. Unfortunately, sometimes,
it is inevitable.

We always make sure to document these changes to make the transition as easy as
possible for you. This release has the following backward-incompatible changes:

{% details "1-Wire" %}

The unit of measurement has been removed from 1-Wire counters because
`count` is not a unit 😁

([@jrieger] - [#132076]) ([documentation](/integrations/onewire))

[@jrieger]: https://github.com/jrieger
[#132076]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/132076

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Denon HEOS" %}

Grouping a HEOS media player will now raise an exception if one of the members
is not a valid HEOS player. Previously unknown or invalid members would be
silently dropped.

([@andrewsayre] - [#132213]) ([documentation](/integrations/heos))

[@andrewsayre]: https://github.com/andrewsayre
[#132213]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/132213

{% enddetails %}

{% details "devolo Home Control" %}

The integration with devolo Home Control has been updated to remove the option
to set the mydevolo URL. This option was used to set up the integration with
the devolo Home Control Cloud for development purposes only. This option is no
longer available.

([@Shutgun] - [#132821]) ([documentation](/integrations/devolo_home_control))

[@Shutgun]: https://github.com/Shutgun
[#132821]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/132821

{% enddetails %}

{% details "FXCOM RFXtrx" %}

The unit of measurement has been removed from FXCOM RFXtrx counters because
`count` is not a unit 😁

([@jrieger] - [#133108]) ([documentation](/integrations/rfxtrx))

[@jrieger]: https://github.com/jrieger
[#133108]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/133108

{% enddetails %}

{% details "HomeWizard Energy" %}

The unit of measurement for the "Water usage" sensor has been updated from
`l/min` to `L/min`. This change standardizes the unit to improve consistency
across Home Assistant.

Any automations, scripts, or templates that rely on the old unit may need to be
adjusted. Long-term statistics will remain intact, but repair issues will be
created to ensure the data is updated with the new unit.

([@DCSBL] - [#132261]) ([documentation](/integrations/homewizard))

[@DCSBL]: https://github.com/DCSBL
[#132261]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/132261

{% enddetails %}

{% details "LIFX" %}

The options `color_temp` and `kelvin` are no longer valid arguments for LIFX
actions. Please use `color_temp_kelvin` instead.

([@epenet] - [#132730]) ([documentation](/integrations/lifx))

[@epenet]: https://github.com/epenet
[#132730]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/132730

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Tesla Fleet" %}

The included OAuth application credentials have been removed, as Tesla no longer
supports Open Source application registrations, and is moving to a pay-per-use
model.

Read more about this announcement in this [blog post](developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/support/announcements#2024-11-27-pay-per-use-pricing).

([@Bre77] - [#132431]) ([documentation](/integrations/tesla_fleet))

[@Bre77]: https://github.com/Bre77
[#132431]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/132431

{% enddetails %}

{% details "UniFi Network" %}

The states of "Device State" sensors have been standardized to match
Home Assistant core rules and be translatable. This affects the following
UniFi sensor states:

- `Connected`, which now became `connected`
- `Pending`, which now became `pending`
- `Firmware Mismatch`, which now became `firmware_mismatch`
- `Upgrading`, which now became `upgrading`
- `Provisioning`, which now became `provisioning`
- `Heartbeat Missed`, which now became `heartbeat_missed`
- `Adopting`, which now became `adopting`
- `Deleting`, which now became `deleting`
- `Inform Error`, which now became `inform_error`
- `Adoption Failed`, which now became `adoption_failed`
- `Isolated`, which now became `isolated`
- `Unknown`, which now became `unknown`

If you used those states directly in your automations, scripts, or templates;
you will need to adjust those to match these changes.
