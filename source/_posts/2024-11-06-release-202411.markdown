Home Assistant 2024.11! üéâ

It is November already, and we are closing in on the end of the year, but we are
not slowing down!

Before we dive into what this release has to offer, I want to take a moment to
thank everyone who has contributed to the Home Assistant project. You might
have heard this already, but going to share it again:

_**We are number one!** ü•á_

GitHub published its annual [Octoverse report], highlighting the platform's
biggest trends and projects. It named Home Assistant 2024's largest open-source
project, with over 21,000 contributors over the year. **That includes you! ‚ù§Ô∏è**

Continuing the festivities, this release is a big one! The new dashboarding
system we have been working on all year is now out of its experimental phase
and generally available! ü•≥ Exciting, **everyone** can now create beautiful
dashboards with ease!

To top it off, this release also supports faster and lower-latency camera
streams using WebRTC, supported by the [Open Home Foundation].
This is a huge improvement! üéâ

Enjoy the release!

## Sections dashboard no longer experimental!

This release marks a big milestone in our pursuit of making dashboards easier to
customize and use for everyone, aka [Project Grace]! The sections view layout,
together with its drag-and-drop üê≤ capabilities and responsive design,
is now **out of its experimental phase**, and ready for primetime! This means
that, as of this release, you will get our awesome feature-rich and easy-to-use
dashboard editing experience when you create a new dashboard. üéâ

Over the past few months, we have worked hard to iterate and listen to your
feedback to ensure that our new dashboard is easy to customize for both
beginners and advanced users alike. We have added new capabilities such as
[resizing cards], [visibility options], [wider sections], [new badges],
and, most recently, adding [the new heading card].

To finish this journey, we are adding two more features to this release.

[new badges]: /blog/2024/08/07/release-20248/
[Project Grace]: /blog/2024/03/04/dashboard-chapter-1/

### Convert your old dashboards to sections view layout

<p class='img no-shadow'><img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshots showing the conversion of a view in masonry into sections" src="/images/blog/2024-11/dashboard-conversion.png"/>Screenshots showing the conversion of a view in masonry into sections</p>

This release includes a way to convert individual dashboard views from the old
masonry view layout to the new sections view layout. When you change the view
type to sections, you get a button to convert the view. All the cards of the
old view are then copied and placed in an imported cards section in the new
view, and you can then easily drag-and-drop them into the right sections.

Please note that cards placed within the imported cards section are only visible
to users once moved to a section above the fold. This ensures that
cards do not get accidentally shown in the wrong sections while you are still
working on the dashboard.

<p class='img no-shadow'><img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot of the imported cards section" src="/images/blog/2024-11/imported-cards.png"/>Screenshot of the imported cards section</p>

If you are not ready for the new layout yet, no worries! Your old dashboard view
is kept when a new dashboard is created, giving an excellent way for masonry
view veterans to try out sections while keeping all the hard work they have put
into customizing their cards.

Alternatively, you can move each card one-by-one from another view. All moved
cards will also be temporarily placed in the imported cards section.

### Precise mode for card sizes

<p class='img no-shadow'><img class="no-shadow" alt="Examples of cards using precise mode" src="/images/blog/2024-11/precise-mode-example.png" style="width: 60%;"/>Examples of cards using precise mode</p>

If you love tinkering with your dashboards and fine-tuning card sizes with more
precision, you now have even more control over the size of cards. In the layout
options of a card you can now enable ‚ÄúPrecise mode‚Äù, which will give you three
times more options for the card widths!

Precise mode is applied on a card-by-card level. While a normal section is
divided into 4 columns, precise modes gives you 12 columns, which allows you
to align 2, 3, 4, or 6 buttons side-by-side.

## Low latency cameras using WebRTC

Lots of effort has gone into this new and amazing feature for this release:
**WebRTC**! üéâ

<center><p class='no-shadow'><img class="no-shadow" alt="Logo of WebRTC" src="/images/blog/2024-11/webrtc-logo-horiz-retro.png" /></p></center>

Not sure [what WebRTC is]? No worries! Let us try to explain. If you are
watching a camera in Home Assistant, you might have noticed it is sometimes
a bit slow and delayed. WebRTC support is going to change that!

Camera streams will now try to use WebRTC whenever possible.
[WebRTC is a standard] that makes a peer-to-peer connection for lower-latency
audio and video streaming. You are probably using this technology a lot already,
for example, when having an online video call. When you‚Äôre away from home,
it will try to find the fastest and most direct path between your Home Assistant
instance and the camera you are trying to view.

[The Open Home Foundation] will host the negotiating network infrastructure
([STUN servers]) **for free for all Home Assistant users** and enable the
capability to use WebRTC for peer-to-peer connections whenever possible. If you are using Home Assistant OS or our containers, after you update this will automatically work out of the box.

<center><p class='no-shadow'><img class="no-shadow" alt="Logo of the Open Home Foundation" src="https://www.openhomefoundation.org/assets/images/logo/open-home-foundation.svg" style="width: 90%" /></p></center>

Sometimes, a direct connection between the client (like your browser
or mobile app) and the camera is not possible; in those situations, the camera
stream needs to be relayed by an external server. [Home Assistant Cloud] now
provides this relay server ([TURN server]), and it's **included as one of the many benefits**
available to all subscribers!

So, no matter where you are, you should always be able to watch your cameras
via this low-latency technology. If, for whatever reason, WebRTC is not
available, it will fall back to using the old method of streaming to ensure
you can always see your camera feeds.

So, after reading all of this, what changed? Well, camera feeds will do everything they did before, but will be faster, more responsive, and less delayed! üéâ

## Integrations

Thanks to our community for keeping pace with the new {% term integrations %}
and improvements to existing ones! You‚Äôre all awesome ü•∞

### New integrations

We welcome the following new integrations in this release:

- **[LG ThinQ]**, added by [@LG-ThinQ-Integration]  
  Integrate your LG ThinQ devices, such as air conditioners, refrigerators,
  and washing machines. LG built and provided this integration! It's super nice
  to see a manufacturer providing an integration for Home Assistant.
- **[Husqvarna Automower BLE]**, added by [@alistair23]  
  Integrate your Husqvarna lawnmower using Bluetooth.
- **[Palazzetti]**, added by [@dotvav]  
  Integrate your [Palazzetti pellet stove]; control the stove, fan speeds and get the current temperature.

### Noteworthy improvements to existing integrations

It is not just new {% term integrations %} that have been added; existing
integrations are also being constantly improved. Here are some of the noteworthy
changes to existing integrations:

- [@joostlek] has extended the [Spotify integration] with a whole bunch of new
  sensors for the current song playing. You can now, for example, automate
  putting your house into party mode üéâ when the song playing is danceable
  enough üòé Awesome job!
- The [LinkPlay integration] now has multiroom support! Group and ungroup your
  devices to play music in sync or individually straight from Home Assistant.
  Thanks [@silamon]!
- Staying in the audio department, [@mj23000] added shuffle and repeat controls
  to the [Bang & Olufsen integration]. Nice!
- The [ViCare integration] now supports room sensors and hot water storage
  sensors. Thanks for that [@CFenner]!
- [@starkillerOG] added sensors to track the total number of installations and
  integrations to the [Analytics Insights integration]. Nice!
- The [Habitica integration] now supports sensors for gems, mystic hourglasses,
  and calendars for to-dos and daily tasks. Thanks [@tr4nt0r]!
- [@YogevBokobza] added support for the [Switcher Runner S12] to the
  [Switcher integration]. Thanks for that!
- The [Husqvarna Automower integration] keeps receiving love from [@Thomas55555].
  This release adds work area and progress sensors. Nice!
- [@bdraco] added support for the [SwitchBot Meter Pro] to the
  [SwitchBot integration]. Thanks!
- The [SwitchBot Cloud integration] now supports locks! Thanks [@miterion]!
- A little more technical, but [@jbouwh] added support for
  [MQTT device-based auto discovery]. This allows MQTT devices to be set up
  and discovered once instead of separately for each entity; which is much
  more efficient. Nice improvement!

### Now available to set up from the UI

While most {% term integrations %} can be set up directly from the Home Assistant
user interface, some were only available using YAML configuration. We keep moving
more integrations to the UI, making them more accessible for everyone
to set up and use.

The following integrations are now available via the Home Assistant UI:

- **[Local file]**, done by [@gjohansson-ST]
- **[Onkyo]**, done by [@Nebula83]
- **[Smarty]**, done by [@joostlek]

### Farewell to the following

The following {% term integrations %} are also no longer available as
of this release:

- **Bloomsky**. Their service shut down.
- **Google Domains**. The domain registration service by Google has been
  shut down.
- **Spider**. The service is no longer available.

## Other noteworthy changes

There are many more improvements in this release; here are some of the other
noteworthy changes:

- [Image entities] now have a snapshot action, allowing you to save the current
  image in the entity to a file. Nice [@NickM-27]!
- [@Petro31] added [(limited) template] support to the "at" field of [time triggers].
  This allows you to template the time of that trigger in, for example,
  a blueprint automation.
- [Nautical miles] (`nmi`) is now a valid distance unit. This means you can now
  use this as a unit for your distance sensors. Thanks [@mib1185]!
- [@tetele] added [blueprints for template entities]! This allows for easier
  re-use and sharing of common blueprints for sets of templated entities.
  This is an advanced feature and is only available using manual YAML
  configuration.
- [@MindFreeze] and [@matthiasdebaat] have improved the network settings user
  interface. It is now easier to manage and configure your network settings,
  including nicer handling of IP addresses, improved Wi-Fi configuration,
  and better visibility on the URLs Home Assistant is using for your instance.
- We now indicate if a custom integration is overriding a built-in integration.
  This makes it easier to spot if a custom integration is taking over a
  built-in integration while you are wondering why you didn't get the latest
  features Home Assistant releases bring. Thanks, [@MindFreeze]!

### Live logs

Sometimes, if something does not work as expected, you might resort to a more technical
tool for finding out what is going on: The logs.

Previously, if you looked at the logs of, for example, an add-on or the Home
Assistant Supervisor, you would only see the last 100 log lines. You would
have had to refresh the page to see new log entries.

Well, no more! As of this release, the logs are now **streaming live**! üéâ

<p class='img no-shadow'><img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot of the imported cards section" src="/images/blog/2024-11/streaming-live-logs.gif"/>Screen recording demonstrating logs showing up as they happen.</p>

And not just that, you can scroll back in time to see previous log items.
That's a pretty cool improvement. üòé

## Voice

Last year, 2023, was the [Year of the Voice] for Home Assistant. And while this
year isn't specifically dedicated to voice, everyone is still working hard
towards the goal of letting users control their homes with their voice in
their own language.

As you might have heard through many community channels üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è, we are working to
make this a reality for everyone. We are hard at work getting our Home Assistant
voice satellite hardware ready and available for selling and shipping! ü§ó

Stay tuned for more information on that soon!

[Year of the Voice]: /blog/2022/12/20/year-of-voice/

### Home Assistant intents improvements

One of the things we are working on is the Home Assistant intents. This is a
way for a voice assistant to understand the intention behind your spoken
sentences. This is a very crucial part of a local voice assistant.

In this release, we decided to align and combine Canadian French and French languages for the time being. Though we understand it is a unique dialect, this is about giving Canadian French users a lot more voice features.

![Screenshot showing a few commands in Canadian French before and after this release](/images/blog/2024-11/canadian-french-on-assist.png)

These intents are built and maintained by the community, and we are very
grateful for their work. For example, [@piitaya] and [@jlpouffier] have made a
great effort to lead the French language intents mentioned above.

Nevertheless, we want to ensure everyone can use Home Assistant in their
own language, **so we need your help**! Help the community by contributing to
the intents for your language. You can find more information on how to do that
in our [developer documentation].

[@piitaya]: https://github.com/piitaya
[developer documentation]: https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/voice/intent-recognition/contributing

### Join the Wake Word Collective

Another essential part of voice is the Wake Word! And this is where **everyone**,
no matter your skill level, can help out with just a minute of your time!

Wake words are the words you say to wake up your voice assistant. For example,
_"Hey Google"_ or _"Alexa"_. As we are building our own voice assistant with
our own wake words, we need to train our models to recognize these words,
regardless of your accent, language, gender, or age.

So, get your whole home involved üè†! Take a minute to help us out by recording your voice
saying the wake word. It is super easy, and you can do it right from your
browser or mobile, no need to install anything!

[**Help us improve our wake words today! ‚ù§Ô∏è**](https://ohf-voice.github.io/wake-word-collective/)

You can read more about the Wake Word Collective in our
[dedicated blog post](/blog/2024/10/24/wake-word-collective/).

## Patch releases

## Backward-incompatible changes

We do our best to avoid making changes to existing functionality that might
unexpectedly impact your Home Assistant installation. Unfortunately, sometimes,
it is inevitable.

We always make sure to document these changes to make the transition as easy as
possible for you. This release has the following backward-incompatible changes:

{% details "A. O. Smith" %}

A. O. Smith now provides the hot water status as a percentage rather than low,
medium, or high. The hot water status entity has been updated accordingly.

([@bdr99] - [#127678]) ([documentation](/integrations/aosmith))

[@bdr99]: https://github.com/bdr99
[#127678]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/127678

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Google Calendar" %}

Google Calendar events that are declined are now omitted from the calendar.

([@joelhawksley] - [#128900]) ([documentation](/integrations/google))

[@joelhawksley]: https://github.com/joelhawksley
[#128900]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/128900

{% enddetails %}

{% details "HomeKit" %}

Historically, many integrations implemented doorbells as binary sensors with a
device class of occupancy. This design was replaced with the new event entities,
which use a purpose-built device class of doorbell.

HomeKit will no longer automatically link binary sensors with device class
occupancy as linked doorbell sensors. However, linked doorbell sensors can
still be configured manually via YAML.

([@bdraco] - [#127668]) ([documentation](/integrations/homekit))

[@bdraco]: https://github.com/bdraco
[#127668]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/127668

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Litter-Robot" %}

Previously, Litter-Robot could have an off state. This has now changed to
`docked`, as¬†`off`¬†isn‚Äôt a valid state for¬†vacuum¬†entities.

([@gjohansson-ST] - [#128297]) ([documentation](/integrations/litterrobot))

[@gjohansson-ST]: https://github.com/gjohansson-ST
[#128297]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/128297

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Netatmo" %}

The preset modes of the thermostat have been renamed in order to support
translations `Schedule`, `Frost guard`, and `Manual` have been renamed to
`schedule`, `frost_guard`, and `manual`.

([@piitaya] - [#128890]) ([documentation](/integrations/netatmo))

[@piitaya]: https://github.com/piitaya
[#128890]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/128890

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Tibber" %}

The `tibber.get_prices` action has been adjusted to return datetimes as strings
instead of raw datetime objects.

Automations or template sensors using this may need to be modified with an
`as_datetime` filter. See our [templating documentation](/docs/configuration/templating/#time)
for more information on using these filters.

([@functionpointer] - [#123901]) ([documentation](/integrations/tibber))

[@functionpointer]: https://github.com/functionpointer
[#123901]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/123901

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Updates" %}

State attributes of update entities have been changed:

- The `in_progress` state attribute is now always a `bool`, never an integer.
- A new state attribute `update_percentage` has been added. The
  `update_percentage` is a number between 0-100 if an update is in progress
  and the entity supports reporting progress, or `None` if an update is not
  in progress or an update is in progress but the entity does not support
  reporting progress.

Scripts, automations, custom frontend components, etc., which consume the
`in_progress`¬†state attribute of update entities, need to be updated accordingly.

([@emontnemery] - [#128877]) ([documentation](/integrations/update))

[@emontnemery]: https://github.com/emontnemery
[#128877]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/128877

{% enddetails %}

{% details "WMS WebControl pro" %}

The open/closed state of awnings will be inverted so that the UI visualization
and positioning match reality. This means open (100%) now refers to the awning
being completely retracted, and closed (0%) now means the awning is fully
expanded. This is not in line with industry terminology, but Home Assistant
does not yet natively support awnings of type patio.

([@mback2k] - [#128079]) ([documentation](/integrations/wmspro))

[@mback2k]: https://github.com/mback2k
[#128079]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/128079
